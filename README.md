# wordle-cracker
This Python program will solve Wordle puzzles and generate practice Wordle puzzles.

When run in the same directory as 'og_word_list', this program will help you solve a Wordle puzzle by listing possible solutions based on words you have already tried. It can also generate Wordle puzzles for you to play (operating with the same rules as the usual Wordle puzzle).
